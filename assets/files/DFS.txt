First is to say Bismillahi 

*Next is to wash the two palms while using the left fingers to wash in-between the right fingers and doing the same for the left palm.* All these should be done thrice

*Next is to rinse the mouth and nostrils.* These two actions should be done simultaneously, with just one handful of water. How?
With a handful of water, you take some from the water to rinse your mouth and gaggle it, then you sniff the remaining water with your nose, you blow it out, then you throw or spit out the water in your mouth. It is pertinent to take note and be conscious of these particular steps:
*i. Rinsing the mouth and gaggle the water*
*ii. Sniffing the water and blowing it out*
*iii. Then spitting out the water in your mouth.*
All these should be done thrice.

*Next is to wash the face from where the hair sprouts to the lower part of the jaw (in length) and from one earlobe to the other earlobe (in width).* This is done thrice using either the two hands to wash the face or one hand (both of them are correct).

*Next is to wash the hand from the palm straight to the upper part of the arm.* That is, we should extend the washing above the elbow to the part of the arm where we have chunk of flesh (popularly called muscle). We do this thrice for both the right and left hand. 
*Kindly note that the palms and fingers are also part of the hand so it should be rewashed in this aspect.*

*Next is to wipe the head with the two ears.* How? As against washing, the head and ears are wiped not washed. We take water in our palms or wet our palms, interlock the fingers of the right hand to the left, then we run the interlocked fingers across our head either from the front to the back (nape - where hair stops) and return it to the front. Or we start wiping from the nape to the frontal hair and return the wiping to the nape.
 
*Next is to wash our feet by using the smallest finger of our left hand to wash in-between our toes( this is obligatory).*

Then we say the shahadah *(ash-hadu an la ilaaha illaLlaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan' abduhu wa Rasooluhu) and du'a (Allaahummaj'alni minattawwa-beena waj'alni minal mutataahhireen) , then we end it by saying subhanka Allaahumma wa bi hamdika , ash-hadu an la ilaaha illa Ant, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaik.*
